INTRODUCTION                                                   *conjoin-intro*

conjoin is a plugin that handles line joining in the presence of line
continuation characters and merges literal strings.  Vim's normal behavior for
|J| and |:join| on the following shell script:
>
  cat file.txt \
    | sort \
    | uniq -c
<
leaves the backslash continuation characters in place:
>
  cat file.txt \ | sort \ | uniq -c
<
With conjoin, running join commands on the same script will produce
>
  cat file.txt | sort | uniq -c
<
(|gJ| does the same but doesn't adjust leading/trailing space.)

conjoin also merges quoted string literals, which are often spread over
multiple lines.  For example, in Python:
>
  print('Lorem ipsum '
        'sic dolor amet,'
        + ' consectetur adipisicing elit')
<
would normally be joined as
>
  print('Lorem ipsum ' 'sic dolor amet,' + ' consectetur adipisicing elit')
<
but conjoin will join it into a single literal string:
>
  print('Lorem ipsum sic dolor amet, consectetur adipisicing elit')
<

If the plugin https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat is installed, |conjoin-J|,
|conjoin-gJ|, |conjoin-v_J|, and |conjoin-v_gJ| can be repeated with |.| .
Repeating a command will join the same number of lines as the original command
count or visual line count.  Like |:join|, |:Join| is not repeatable.

Note that vim already removes leading comment characters when joining lines in
a block comment when |formatoptions| contains the 'j' flag.  conjoin currently
removes line continuation characters in comments and does not merge strings
with intervening comment characters.  For example,
>
  # Line 1 \
  # "Line 2" +
  # "Line 3"
<
will join as
>
  # Line 1 "Line 2" "Line 3"
<
but
>
  /* "Line 1" +
   * "Line 2" +
     "Line 3"
   */
<
will join as
>
  /* "Line 1" + "Line 2Line3" */
<
This comment behavior is subject to change.

conjoin works with several programming languages by default, see
|conjoin-config| for details.

COMMANDS                                                    *conjoin-commands*

:[range]Join[!] [count] [flags]                                        *:Join*
  Like :[range]join[!] [count] [flags] but removes continuation characters and
  merges trailing/leading concatenated string literals.  Before joining lines,
  trailing line continuation characters are removed from each line in the
  range before the last and leading line continuation characters are removed
  from each line after the first.

MAPPINGS                                                    *conjoin-mappings*

*conjoin-J* J  Join [count] lines, as with the builtin |J| command.  Before
joining lines, trailing and/or leading continuation escape characters will be
removed from the lines to be joined and trailing/leading literal strings will
be merged.

*conjoin-v_J* {Visual}J  Join the highlighted lines, as with the builtin |v_J|
command. Before joining lines, trailing and/or leading continuation escape
characters will be removed from the lines to be joined and trailing/leading
literal strings will be merged.

*conjoin-gJ* gJ  Like J but with joining semantics like the builtin |gJ|.

*conjoin-v_gJ* {Visual}gJ  Like J but with joining semantics like the builtin
|v_gJ|.

If these keys have existing mappings, conjoin will call the prior mapping
after removing continuation characters.  This allows conjoin to delegate gJ to
the |splitjoin| plugin as long as splitjoin appears before conjoin in
|runtimepath|.

You can use different mappings for conjoin (not touching J/gJ) by setting the
appropriate variable:
>
  let g:conjoin_map_J = '<Leader>z'
  let g:conjoin_map_gJ = '<Leader>x'
<

CONFIGURATION                                                 *conjoin-config*

|g:conjoin_filetypes| configures continuation patterns for many programming
lanugages.  It is a dict with filetypes (e.g. "sh", "ruby", "vim") as keys and
conjoin pattern dicts as values.  A conjoin dict has optional `trailing` and
`leading` keys mapped to regular expression patterns. A conjoin dict may also
have a `quote` entry mapped to a list of 2-element lists of trailing/leading
patterns for string literal concatenation, e.g.
>
  [['"\s*+\s*$', '^\s*"'], ['"\s*$', '^\s*+\s*"']]
<
for double-quoted string literals concatenated with a + operator. When conjoin
mappings or functions are called, the current buffer's 'filetype' is looked up
in g:conjoin_filetypes.  If it contains a conjoin dict, the "trailing" pattern
will be matched against each join line (except the last) and the "leading"
pattern will be matched against each join line (except the first).  Make sure
to include $ at the end of trailing patterns and ^ at the beginning of leading
patterns.  Example use in .vimrc:
>
  if !exists('g:conjoin_filetypes')
    let g:conjoin_filetypes = {}
  endif
  g:conjoin_filetypes.intercal = #{leading: '^\s*PLEASE', trailing: '\\$'}
  g:conjoin_filetypes.lolcode = #{quote: [['\s*MKAY?\s*$', '^\s*SMOOSH']]}
<
A buffer-local variable b:conjoin_patterns can replace the global filetype
settings.

Setting |g:conjoin_merge_strings|=0 or |b:conjoin_merge_strings|=0 will
disable merging string literals.

FUNCTIONS                                                  *conjoin-functions*

conjoin#joinNormal({cmd})                               *conjoin#joinNormal()*
  Removes continuation characters, merges string literals, and then joins
  lines as if (count) {cmd} were typed in normal mode.  If cmd is empty (or
  otherwise neither J nor gJ) then no command will be performed to join the
  lines, with the expectation that a mapping will initiate its own join
  operation.  This function is typically called from the from a mapping
  established in plugin/conjoin.vim.

conjoin#joinVisual({cmd})                               *conjoin#joinVisual()*
  Removes continuation characters, merges string literals, and then joins
  lines as if (count) {cmd} were typed in visual mode.  If cmd is empty (or
  otherwise neither J nor gJ) then no command will be performed to join the
  lines, with the expectation that a mapping will initiate its own join
  operation.  This function is typically called from the from a mapping
  established in plugin/conjoin.vim.

conjoin#joinEx({line1}, {line2}, {range}, {bang}, {qargs})  *conjoin#joinEx()*
  Removes continuation characters, merges string literals, and then joins
  lines as if :[range]join[!] were typed in ex mode.  This function is
  typically called from the :Join command.
