# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Change Guidelines

Most changes should be discussed in a GitHub issue first.  This plugin should
do one thing well—intuitive line joining.  I may therefore reject feature
requests that stray from that focus.

Pull requests are welcome to fix vim compatibility issues or to support
continuation lines for additional languages.

## Community Guidelines

The Internet brings together billions of people with different backgrounds,
values, worldviews, and personal situations.  Be excellent to each other, and
don’t be a jerk when participating in open source software.  Please follow the
[Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/).
