" Author: Trevor Stone
" Description: Plugin which maps J and gJ to remove line continuation
" characters when joining lines and merge literal strings.  Works with J/gJ
" alone, with a count, or in visual mode.  Also provides a :[range]Join[!]
" command.

""
" @section Introduction, intro
" @order intro commands mappings config functions
" conjoin is a plugin that handles line joining in the presence of line
" continuation characters and merges literal strings.  Vim's normal behavior
" for |J| and |:join| on the following shell script: >
"   cat file.txt \
"     | sort \
"     | uniq -c
" <
" leaves the backslash continuation characters in place: >
"   cat file.txt \ | sort \ | uniq -c
" <
" With conjoin, running join commands on the same script will produce >
"   cat file.txt | sort | uniq -c
" <
" (|gJ| does the same but doesn't adjust leading/trailing space.)
"
" conjoin also merges quoted string literals, which are often spread over
" multiple lines.  For example, in Python: >
"   print('Lorem ipsum '
"         'sic dolor amet,'
"         + ' consectetur adipisicing elit')
" < would normally be joined as >
"   print('Lorem ipsum ' 'sic dolor amet,' + ' consectetur adipisicing elit')
" < but conjoin will join it into a single literal string: >
"   print('Lorem ipsum sic dolor amet, consectetur adipisicing elit')
" <
"
" If the plugin https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat is installed,
" |conjoin-J|, |conjoin-gJ|, |conjoin-v_J|, and |conjoin-v_gJ| can be repeated
" with |.| .  Repeating a command will join the same number of lines as the
" original command count or visual line count.  Like |:join|, |:Join| is not
" repeatable.
"
" Note that vim already removes leading comment characters when joining lines
" in a block comment when |formatoptions| contains the 'j' flag.  conjoin
" currently removes line continuation characters in comments and does not
" merge strings with intervening comment characters.  For example, >
"   # Line 1 \
"   # "Line 2" +
"   # "Line 3"
" < will join as >
"   # Line 1 "Line 2" "Line 3"
" < but >
"   /* "Line 1" +
"    * "Line 2" +
"      "Line 3"
"    */
" < will join as >
"   /* "Line 1" + "Line 2Line3" */
" <
" This comment behavior is subject to change.
"
" conjoin works with several programming languages by default, see
" @section(config) for details.

""
" @section Mappings, mappings
" *conjoin-J*
" J  Join [count] lines, as with the builtin |J| command.  Before joining
" lines, trailing and/or leading continuation escape characters will be
" removed from the lines to be joined and trailing/leading literal strings
" will be merged.
"
" *conjoin-v_J*
" {Visual}J  Join the highlighted lines, as with the builtin |v_J| command.
" Before joining lines, trailing and/or leading continuation escape characters
" will be removed from the lines to be joined and trailing/leading literal
" strings will be merged.
"
" *conjoin-gJ*
" gJ  Like J but with joining semantics like the builtin |gJ|.
"
" *conjoin-v_gJ*
" {Visual}gJ  Like J but with joining semantics like the builtin |v_gJ|.
"
" If these keys have existing mappings, conjoin will call the prior mapping
" after removing continuation characters.  This allows conjoin to delegate gJ
" to the |splitjoin| plugin as long as splitjoin appears before conjoin in
" |runtimepath|.
"
" You can use different mappings for conjoin (not touching J/gJ) by setting
" the appropriate variable: >
"   let g:conjoin_map_J = '<Leader>z'
"   let g:conjoin_map_gJ = '<Leader>x'
" <

""
" @section Configuration, config
" @setting(g:conjoin_filetypes) configures continuation patterns for many
" programming lanugages.  It is a dict with filetypes (e.g. "sh", "ruby",
" "vim") as keys and conjoin pattern dicts as values.  A conjoin dict has
" optional `trailing` and `leading` keys mapped to regular expression patterns.
" A conjoin dict may also have a `quote` entry mapped to a list of 2-element
" lists of trailing/leading patterns for string literal concatenation, e.g. >
"   [['"\s*+\s*$', '^\s*"'], ['"\s*$', '^\s*+\s*"']]
" < for double-quoted string literals concatenated with a + operator.
" When conjoin mappings or functions are called, the current buffer's
" 'filetype' is looked up in g:conjoin_filetypes.  If it contains a conjoin
" dict, the "trailing" pattern will be matched against each join line (except
" the last) and the "leading" pattern will be matched against each join line
" (except the first).  Make sure to include $ at the end of trailing patterns
" and ^ at the beginning of leading patterns.  Example use in .vimrc: >
"   if !exists('g:conjoin_filetypes')
"     let g:conjoin_filetypes = {}
"   endif
"   g:conjoin_filetypes.intercal = #{leading: '^\s*PLEASE', trailing: '\\$'}
"   g:conjoin_filetypes.lolcode = #{quote: [['\s*MKAY?\s*$', '^\s*SMOOSH']]}
" <
" A buffer-local variable b:conjoin_patterns can replace the global filetype
" settings.
"
" Setting @setting(g:conjoin_merge_strings)=0 or
" @setting(b:conjoin_merge_strings)=0 will disable merging string literals.

" Entries are ordered by the continuation pattern they use:

" Mathematica/Wolfram Language uses a trailing backslash or the special
" Unicode character F3B1 ():
"   mma
" PowerShell uses a trailing backtick preceeded by whitespace ( `):
"   ps1
" Visual Basic etc. use a trailing underscore preceeded by whitespace ( _):
"   autoit cobra vb
" AppleScript uses Option-L/Unicode 00AC NOT SIGN (¬)
"   applescript
" Vim uses a leading backslash and optional space, :help line-continuation
"   vim
" Vroom vim testing framework uses a leading pipe preceded by space:
"   vroom
" Fortran 90+ uses a trailing ampersand and optionally a leading ampersand on
" the next line.  Note that this pattern doesn't require the & to be in column
" 6, nor does it handle other non-zero column 6 values.
"   fortran
" TeX treats an empty trailing comment (%) as a line continuation:
"   context plaintex tex
" m4 uses an empty trailing comment (dnl) to avoid outputting newline:
"   m4
"
" Quote-merging-only languages are listed in alphabetic order after languages
" with line continuation support, which are grouped by syntax.
